This is an unofficial client library for interacting with Udacity courses and users.
It is made up of two parts:

* [Catalog](#catalog)
    * A wrapper for Udacity's public [Catalog API](http://udacity.com/public-api/v0/courses)
* [User](#user)
    * Log into your Udacity account, see user info, and check course progress

### Warning

Note that this is not an official Udacity product. They are allowed to change their internal
API at any time, and I will try my best to make sure this library gets updated as well.

In the end, be sure to use this only for personal purposes, not any serious application with
a lot of users.

### Installation

It's on pip! Or rather, it will be on pip. It's still in development as of now.
